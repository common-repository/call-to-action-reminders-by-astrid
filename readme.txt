A plugin that makes it easy to create Remind Me links and buttons within posts and Call-to-Action reminders at the bottom of posts

== Description ==

= Astrid Remind Me =
**Help readers act on suggestions**
This plugin is a zero configuration plugin that allows authors to add Remind Me links within their posts and Call-to-Action reminders at the bottom of each post.

**Remind Me Links**
Add Astrid Remind Me links within the body of the post.
Remind me links help readers look like any other link in your post. By default they also include the prefix "âœ“ Remind Me: " but this can be removed.
When adding a Remind Me link the only information you need to add is the text that will be displayed to the user when they receive the reminder.

*Example Reminder:*
> Buy flowers early for mothers day

*Example Note:*
> Check RetailMeNot for coupon codes before you send them!
> http://www.retailmenot.com/view/ftd.com

*Adding reminder time*
Specify when the reminder should be sent to the user. By default a reminder is sent 3 days after the user clicks but it can be set to a specific date (yyyy-mm-dd format). 

*Reminder Date Example*
> To make sure the arrive in time for Mother's day on Sunday May 12th the date might be:
> 2012-05-01

= Remind Me Buttons =
Remind Me Buttons are identical to Remind Me links but appear as a button. There are three button styles and three button sizes to choose from.

= Call-to-Action Reminders =
Astrid Call-to-Action are the easiest way to help readers act on a post. Add the Call-To-Action at the bottom of the post to summarize next steps for visitors.

= Use of Astrid.com Services =

= url shortener = 
When adding a Remind Me button to your post Astrid will send the reminder to Astrid.com to create a custom short code url.
eg http://astrd.co/QtM5gy 
The short code provides a simple metric as to how many clicks your link has generated. You can view how many clicks on the shortcode by adding a plus "+" to the end of the url.
eg http://astrd.co/QtM5gy+
